/* After seeing the solution to this exercise, I was surprised by how short
it was. To me, it seems like that approach leaves almost no room to allow
for adjusting any indvidual element efficiently. For example, it uses
align-text: center on the body selector, which works if the page is
expected to stay this simple, but you'd have to rewrite the whole structure
if you decide to change the text alignment for any element.

Of course, I do understand the importance of not over-engineering things
before they're needed in the first place. In a way, I think my approach
taught me more about flexbox by nesting more, but going forward,
I'll try and keep things more simple. */
